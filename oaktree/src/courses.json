Once collected, these datasets can be analyzed in a number of different ways to tell useful things about the populations the class is curious about.  The primary focus of this course will be to help students understand and apply certain quantitative tools that sociologists regularly use to identify, verify and interpret specific patterns among individuals, groups, and societies.
