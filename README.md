# Becoming Rusty

This repository is my collection (and journey) of learning a new programming language in depth.  My primary langauges
have been C and C++.  I've worked in Java, Python, Kotlin, and Erlang frequently with my work as a university teacher.
I started looking at Rust in 2019 very casually.  Starting in 2024, I have set a learning goal to understand Rust
and become proficient with it.

One has to start somewhere.

## Current Activity

I'm writing an HTTP Server with a custom Thread Pool (called it a Thread Family).  It is located in the web_server folder.

## Plans

* ChatGPT Helped me with a starting list:
	-[x] **Basic CLI Calculator**: Implement a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
	-[x] **Reverse String**: Write a program that takes a string input and reverses it.
	-[x] **Palindrome Checker**: Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
	-[x] **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms.
	-[x] **Prime Number Checker**: Develop a program that determines whether a given number is prime or not.
	-[x] **Temperature Converter**: Build a program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
	-[x] **File Reader**: Write a program to read a text file and display its contents.
	-[x] **File Writer**: Create a program that writes data to a text file.
	-[ ] **Simple HTTP Server**: Implement a basic HTTP server that serves static files.
	-[ ] **Markdown to HTML Converter**: Build a program that converts Markdown files to HTML.
	-[ ] **Simple Todo List**: Create a simple command-line todo list application.
	-[ ] **Basic Image Processing**: Develop a program that performs basic image processing operations like resizing or converting formats.
	-[ ] **Basic Database Interface**: Write a program that interacts with a SQLite database to perform CRUD operations.
	-[ ] **Simple Chat Application**: Implement a basic chat application using sockets or a higher-level library.
	-[ ] **JSON Parser**: Build a simple JSON parser that can parse and manipulate JSON data.
	-[ ] **Simple Web Scraper**: Create a program that scrapes data from a website.
	-[ ] **Command-Line Password Manager**: Develop a command-line password manager application.
	-[ ] **Basic Encryption/Decryption**: Write a program that encrypts and decrypts text using a simple algorithm like Caesar cipher.
	-[ ] **Simple Raytracer**: Implement a basic raytracer to render simple scenes.
	-[x] **Basic Data Structures**: Implement common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees from scratch.	
* Make a FAQ of what I've learned about the language.
* Would it make sense to use Rust in some of my CS courses?
* Larger Project?
